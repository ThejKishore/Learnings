apt-cache search jdk

(Note: openjdk-8-jdk is symbolically used here. You can choose the JDK version as per your requirement.)

For "JAVA_HOME" (Environment Variable) type command as shown below, in "Terminal" using your installation path...

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk

(Note: "/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk" is symbolically used here just for demostration. You should use your path as per your installation.)

For "PATH" (Environment Variable) type command as shown below, in "Terminal" using your installation path...

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/bin

(Note: "/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk" is symbolically used here just for demostration. You should use your path as per your installation.)

Step 3: Download Gradle

Gradle distribution archive comes in two types: "binary-only" and "complete". The "binary-only" archive contains the Gradle software only wheres "complete" archive comes with binary, documentation and source. Run the following command to download Gradle to your system.

wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.4.1-bin.zip

You can always check the Gradle release page to look for the link to the latest version of Gradle.
Step 4: Install Gradle

Create a directory for the Gradle installation.

sudo mkdir /opt/gradle

Extract the downloaded archive to the newly created directory.

sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle gradle-3.4.1-bin.zip

Configure the PATH environment variable so that the gradle executable can be directly executed anywhere on the system.

export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle/gradle-3.5/bin

You can run the following command to check if the Gradle install was successful.

gradle -v

You should see the following output.
